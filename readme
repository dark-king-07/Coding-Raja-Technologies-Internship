This is a repository which contains the AI internship of Coding Raja. This is a Live Object Detection

Description: Develop a system that can detect and track objects of interest in video streams using deep learning.

Steps involved :

Data Collection: Gather a dataset of videos containing the objects you want to detect and track.

Data Preprocessing: Extract video frames and annotate them with bounding boxes around objects.

Model Selection: Choose an object detection model like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN.

Model Training: Train the chosen model on the annotated frames to recognize objects.

Real-time Detection: Implement the model to detect objects in real-time video streams.

Object Tracking: Use techniques like Kalman filters or optical flow to track detected objects across frames.

Visualization: Visualize the detected and tracked objects in the video.

Tech Stack:
Python
Deep Learning frameworks (TensorFlow or PyTorch)
Computer vision libraries (OpenCV)
